## Chapter 6 - Getting More Out of Our Objects with Descriptors

* Descriptors are another distinctive feature of Python that take object-oriented programming to another level, 
and their potential allows users to build more powerful and reusable abtractions. Most of the time, the full potential
of descriptors is observed in libraries or frameworks
* A descriptor is an object that is an instance of a class that implements the descriptor protocol
* A descriptor has the magic methods (__get__, __set__, __delete__, __set_name__)
* A domain model - A diagram of class definitions and their interaction.
* A descriptor must be defined by the class atribute and not an instance attribute of a class
*
